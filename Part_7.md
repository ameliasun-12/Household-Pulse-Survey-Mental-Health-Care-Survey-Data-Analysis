# Intro to Python Project: Data Analysis of “Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks” Data Set
By Amelia Sun

## Conclusions

#### Prevalance
The most common percentage was 10% with another spike around the low 20%s. While not the majority, this showcases a significant amount of people who indicated that they needed assistance with their mental health. 



While this survey was done during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important not to jump to conclusions and assume that certain subgroups of people have more mental health needs due to the pandemic. Many groups, such as the disabled and transgender (two groups with notably higher percentages seeking therapy and medication in the survey), are more predisposed to stress and mental health issues than others. However, while this dataset cannot be used to say that these levels were caused by the pandemic, it can be used to observe the mental health of people during it without assigning any sort of specific reason.
